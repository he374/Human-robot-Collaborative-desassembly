# Human-robot-Collaborative-desassembly


The collaboration between robots and humans (HRC) is becoming a staple of modern industry. Unlike conventional automation, collaborative robots are built to work alongside people and share common environments. This could increase productivity, flexibility and safety while still maintaining human expertise at a core of complex tasks.

This project demonstrates an intelligent collaborative disassembly system, which involves robotics technology, visual computing technology and human–machine interaction technology. The aim of the task is to facilitate a human operator with the aid of a collaborative robot in a disassembly operation, hence guaranteeing that safe and efficient collaboration ensue.

The collaborative robot, ABB YuMi IRB 14000 manufactured by ABB and 3D perception camera Intel RealSense D435 provided by Intel are used in the system.
The platform enables:
  1.Object and component detection
  2.Monitoring of operator actions
  3.Human and robot communicate using gestures
  4.Synchronization of operator and robot tasks

The project is organised in two major sections.

Here's a breakdown of the key areas we'll be focusing on:

  A.Modeling and Simulation:
    We'll start by designing the collaborative robotic cell. This involves simulating various scenarios to understand how the robot and humans will interact. We'll pay close attention to      safety zones and how humans and robots will work together.
    
  B.Vision and Interaction: 
    Next, we'll use computer vision to detect objects. We'll track the disassembly process and use gesture recognition to enable seamless communication between humans and robots.

The ultimate aim is to showcase how collaborative robotics can significantly enhance industrial processes, specifically in areas like recycling, maintenance, and product disassembly.

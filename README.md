# Human-robot-Collaborative-desassembly


The collaboration between robots and humans (HRC) is becoming a staple of modern industry. Unlike conventional automation, collaborative robots are built to work alongside people and share common environments. This could increase productivity, flexibility and safety while still maintaining human expertise at a core of complex tasks.

This project demonstrates an intelligent collaborative disassembly system, which involves robotics technology, visual computing technology and human–machine interaction technology. The aim of the task is to facilitate a human operator with the aid of a collaborative robot in a disassembly operation, hence guaranteeing that safe and efficient collaboration ensue.
